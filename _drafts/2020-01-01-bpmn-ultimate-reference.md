The BPMN 2.0 Ultimate Reference contains information about the different types of BPMN diagrams together with the set of
elements used during the modelling process. This also serves as a reference to understand the different bpmn elements, 
types and guidelines on each of the elements.

## What is BPMN?
> "Business Process Model and Notation has become the de-facto standard for business processes diagrams. It is intended 
> to be used directly by the stakeholders who design, manage and realize business processes, but at the same time be 
> precise enough to allow BPMN diagrams to be translated into software process components. BPMN has an easy-to-use 
> flowchart-like notation that is independent of any particular implementation environment." ~ [BPMN Specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/)
